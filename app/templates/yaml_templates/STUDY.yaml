Study_Description:
- "We collected six biological replicates for a community initially consisting of\
  \ f ive common gut bacterial species that fill different metabolic niches. After\
  \ an initial 12 hours in batch mode, we switched to chemostat mode and observed\
  \ the community to stabilize after 2\u2013 3 days."
Study_Name:
- Synthetic human gut bacterial community using an automated fermentation system
